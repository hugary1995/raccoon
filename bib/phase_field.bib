  abstract = {We present a phase-field model ({PFM}) for solidification in binary alloys, which is found from the phase-field model for a pure material by direct comparison of the variables for a pure material solidification and alloy solidification. The model appears to be equivalent with the Wheeler-Boettinger-{McFadden} ({WBM}) model [A.A. Wheeler, W. J. Boettinger, and G. B. {McFadden}, Phys. Rev. A 45, 7424 (1992)], but has a different definition of the free energy density for interfacial region. An extra potential originated from the free energy density definition in the {WBM} model disappears in this model. At a dilute solution limit, the model is reduced to the Tiaden et al. model [Physica D 115, 73 (1998)] for a binary alloy. A relationship between the phase-field mobility and the interface kinetics coefficient is derived at a thin-interface limit condition under an assumption of negligible diffusivity in the solid phase. For a dilute alloy, a steady-state solution of the concentration profile across the diffuse interface is obtained as a function of the interface velocity and the resultant partition coefficient is compared with the previous solute trapping model. For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface {PFM} are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. As the partition coefficient becomes close to unit at high interface velocities, whereas, the sharp-interface {PFM} yields the correct answer.},

abstract = {The phase-field method has been established as a de facto standard for simulating the microstructural evolution of materials. In quantitative modeling the assessment and compilation of thermodynamic/kinetic data is largely dominated by the CALPHAD approach, which has produced a large set of experimentally and computationally generated Gibbs free energy and atomic mobility data in a standardized format: the thermodynamic database (TDB) file format. Harnessing this data for the purpose of phase-field modeling is an ongoing effort encompassing a wide variety of approaches. In this paper, we aim to directly link CALPHAD data to the phase-field method, without intermediate fitting or interpolation steps. We introduce a model based on the Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) approach. This model includes sublattice site fractions and can directly utilize data from TDB files. Using this approach, we demonstrate the model on the U-Zr and Mo-Ni-Re systems.}
