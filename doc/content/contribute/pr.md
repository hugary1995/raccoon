## Pull Request

After you've added commits to your fork of RACCOON, you can submit a pull request and request our review. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create a pull request. Once you've opened a pull request, you will notice that a continuous-integration build automatically starts.

Once all the regression tests in the continuous-integration build passed, and someone (not yourself) reviewed and approved your pull request, your proposed pull request will be merged into the devel branch of `hugary1995/raccoon`.
