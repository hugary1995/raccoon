## Pull Request

After you add changes to your fork of RACCOON, you can open a pull request to ask us to review your changes before merging them into the project. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create a pull request. Once you opened a pull request, you will notice that a continuous-integration build automatically starts and the merge button is blocked:

Once all the regression tests in the continuous-integration build passed, and someone (not yourself) reviewed and approved your pull request, your proposed pull request will be merged into the upstream RACCOON.
