# Theory

The general theory of phase-field approaches to fracture is summarized below. The derivation begins with the definition of state variables and kinematics:

- [State variables and kinematics](theory/kinematics.md)

First, the thermodynamics of the system is discussed:

- [Thermodynamics](theory/thermodynamics.md)

Then, the problem of interest is cast into a minimization problem, and the governing equations follow from the minimization procedure:

- [The minimization problem](theory/minimization.md)

The list of available constitutive models in RACCOON are listed here:

- [Constitutive models](theory/constitutive_models.md)

The resulting initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP) is discretized using the finite element method.
