The up-front testing also greatly reduces the burden of developing test cases just prior to the release of the software. Finally, by making test development part of the normal development process, many of the steps of creating quality software are automatic and natural to the developers on the project.</p><p>Most of the testing for release is performed automatically on a daily basis by <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment" data-position="top" data-delay="50">MOOSE</span>&#x27;s companion continuous integration software called <span>Continuous Integration for Verification, Enhancement, and Testing (CIVET)</span> for each potential candidate release. After automated test has successfully completed, an automated merge is made into the application&#x27;s &quot;stable&quot; branch, which has undergone extensive testing on multiple platforms, multiple compilers, and often under various configurations and execution strategies. Each one of these versions or commits on the stable branch could potentially be adopted for a supported deployment release. </p></section></section><section class="scrollspy" id="7d75c038-77e6-463b-8f90-6619ded4a39f" data-section-level="2" data-section-text="Test Objectives"><h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2><p>There are several objectives sought in the testing of the <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment" data-position="top" data-delay="50">MOOSE</span> framework and MOOSE-based applications. Those objectives fall into five categories: unit testing, numerical verification, output behaviors, performance, and error testing. Thorough testing of all of these categories provides the asset owners the necessary confidence that the software will perform as expected in a deployment scenario as different end-user defined inputs are used beyond the built-in <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment" data-position="top" data-delay="50">MOOSE</span> test cases.

The MOOSE repository includes a general-purpose, extendable &quot;Test Harness&quot;, which is heavily leveraged to run the MOOSE test suite in every location where MOOSE-based software is deployed. The Test Harness is used throughout all phases of MOOSE development from initial development, the change request process, deployment testing, and finally end-use in-situ testing.
